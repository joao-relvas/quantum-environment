## QUANTUM PLATFORM

Hey, so this is an attempt of building a quantum platform.

It will have (whenever I finnish it, which should be in about a year):
    - quantum compiler.
    - neural network to optimize the quantum hardware (choosing the best gates, etc).
    - neural network to control and correct qubits.
    - quantum simulator (since I dont have access to any quantum hardware).
    - neural network to design and sutdy new quantum algorithms/circuits.
    - quantum machine learning engine.
    - quantum language compiled by the quantum compiler.
    - gate-level, hardware-level and optimization Intermediate Representations.
